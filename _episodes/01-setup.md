## Why Environment Setup Matters

AI weather forecasting models require specialized hardware (GPUs) and software environments to run efficiently. Unlike traditional weather models that run on CPUs, modern AI models like GraphCast, Aurora, and AIFS leverage GPU acceleration for:

- **Fast inference**: 10-day global forecasts in minutes instead of hours
- **Ensemble generation**: Running multiple forecast scenarios simultaneously
- **High-resolution predictions**: 0.25° grid resolution with complex neural architectures

A reproducible environment ensures that:
- Results can be replicated across different DGX Spark nodes
- Model weights and dependencies are consistent
- GPU resources are properly allocated and monitored

## 1. GPU Verification

The DGX Spark systems run Docker in rootless mode with NVIDIA's Container Device Interface (CDI). This provides secure, user-level GPU access without requiring root privileges.

### 1.1 Verify GPU Visibility

Confirm that Docker can access the GPU by running:

```bash
docker run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all ubuntu nvidia-smi -L
```

**Expected output:**
```
GPU 0: NVIDIA H100 80GB HBM3 (UUID: GPU-xxxxx)
```

:::{warning}
#### Common Issue: Unresolvable CDI Devices
If the command fails with `unresolvable CDI devices nvidia.com/gpu=all`, Docker started before the GPU registry was populated. This commonly occurs immediately after a system reboot.
:::

**Solution:** Restart the Docker service:

```bash
systemctl --user restart docker
```

Then retry the GPU verification command.

### 1.2 Preventative Configuration

To prevent this issue from recurring after every reboot, configure Docker to wait for the GPU registry:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/wait-for-gpu.conf <<'EOF'
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "for i in $(seq 120); do [ -s /var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml ] && exit 0; sleep 1; done; exit 0"
EOF
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

:::{tip}
#### Why This Works
The configuration adds a pre-start hook that waits up to 120 seconds for the CDI registry file (`/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`) to appear before starting Docker. This ensures GPU devices are properly registered before Docker attempts to use them.
:::

## 2. Docker Configuration

### 2.1 Understanding Rootless Docker

Rootless Docker runs the Docker daemon as a non-root user, providing:
- **Enhanced security**: No root privileges required
- **User isolation**: Each user manages their own containers
- **Simplified permissions**: No need for sudo or group membership

### 2.2 Container Storage Management

When running AI weather models, Docker manages two primary storage locations:

| Asset Type | Location | Size | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saved forecasts, event movies, job logs | `ai_weather/demo3/outputs/` | Grows with use | Persistent results |
| Model weights (downloaded on first run) | `~/.cache/demo3/` | Up to ~75 GB | Model parameters |

:::{keypoints}
#### Storage Best Practices
- Model weights are downloaded once per model and cached locally
- Saved forecasts accumulate over time; consider periodic cleanup
- Use `DEMO3_CACHE=/path` to redirect weights to high-performance storage
:::

## 3. Container Image Management

### 3.1 Building the Container Image

The container image includes all dependencies for running AI weather models:

```bash
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

**Build characteristics:**
- **First build**: ~1 hour (compiling earth2grid, NATTEN libraries)
- **Subsequent builds**: Seconds (using Docker layer cache)
- **Image contents**: Python environments, dependencies, application code
- **Excluded**: Model weights (downloaded on first run)

:::{note}
#### Build Optimization
Most of the build time is spent compiling two specialized libraries:
- **earth2grid**: Grid interpolation for weather data
- **NATTEN**: Neighborhood attention for transformer architectures

These are compiled from source to ensure compatibility with the target GPU architecture.
:::

### 3.2 Transferring Pre-built Images

To avoid rebuilding on every Spark node, transfer a pre-built image:

```bash
# On the source Spark:
docker save demo3 | gzip > demo3-image.tar.gz

# Transfer via scp/rsync over Tailscale:
scp demo3-image.tar.gz <user>@<target-spark>:~/

# On the target Spark:
docker load < demo3-image.tar.gz
```

:::{exercise}
#### Exercise 1: Image Transfer (5 min)
You have a pre-built image on Spark `hcwfpgx` and need to deploy it to a new Spark `hcwfpgy`. Write the complete sequence of commands to:
1. Export the image from the source Spark
2. Transfer it to the target Spark
3. Load it on the target Spark

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```bash
# On hcwfpgx:
docker save demo3 | gzip > demo3-image.tar.gz
scp demo3-image.tar.gz <user>@hcwfpgy:~/

# On hcwfpgy:
docker load < demo3-image.tar.gz
```

</details>
:::

## 4. Runtime Configuration

### 4.1 Core Setup Commands

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mesfind/ai_weather.git
cd ai_weather/demos/demo3

# 2. Build the container image (~1 hour first time)
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile .

# 3. Start the container
bash docker/run.sh

# 4. Access the UI from your laptop
ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 <user>@<spark>
# Then browse to http://localhost:8501
```

### 4.2 Runtime Configuration Flags

Prepend these flags to `bash docker/run.sh` to customize behavior:

| Flag | Purpose | Example | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DEV=1` | Mount local code for live development | `DEV=1 bash docker/run.sh` | Disabled |
| `DEMO3_CACHE=/path` | Redirect model weight cache location | `DEMO3_CACHE=/shared/cache bash docker/run.sh` | `~/.cache/demo3/` |
| `DEMO3_IFS_SOURCE=azure` | Use Azure mirror for ECMWF data | `DEMO3_IFS_SOURCE=azure bash docker/run.sh` | AWS |
| `DEMO3_FGN_DIR=/path` | FGN weights and sample file location | `DEMO3_FGN_DIR=/data/fgn bash docker/run.sh` | `~/.cache/fgn` |


:::{tip}
#### Development Workflow
Use `DEV=1` during active development to avoid rebuilding the container after every code change. Changes to Python files take effect immediately after a page refresh.
:::

:::{warning}
#### First-Run Downloads
The first execution of each model downloads weights (~75 GB total). This can take 30+ minutes for large models like Atlas CRPS. Subsequent runs start in seconds.
:::

### 4.3 Pre-populating Cache and Outputs

Skip first-run downloads by copying weights and outputs from an existing Spark:

```bash
# Copy model weights
rsync -a --info=progress2 <user>@<spark>:<its weights cache>/ ~/.cache/demo3/

# Copy saved runs
rsync -a --info=progress2 <user>@<spark>:ai_weather/demos/demo3/outputs/ ai_weather/demos/demo3/outputs/
```

**Known cache locations:**
- On `hcwfpgx`: `~/e2s-spark/root_cache`

## 5. Model-Specific Environments

### 5.1 Environment Isolation

Different models require different Python environments, provisioned inside the container at `/opt/envs/<env>/bin/python`:

| Environment | Models | Key Dependencies | Peak GPU Memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `e2s018` | Atlas CRPS, Aurora 1.5, AIFS v2 single | PyTorch, Earth2Studio | 14-33 GB |
| `e2s018ens` | AIFS v2 ENS | PyTorch, ensemble utilities | 25 GB |
| `graphcast` | GraphCast, NeuralGCM | JAX, Graph Neural Networks | 16-18 GB |
| `fgn` | FGN (WeatherNext 2) | JAX, Functional Generative Networks | 1.8 GB |
| `ui` | Streamlit interface | Web framework | N/A |

:::{warning}
#### Environment Isolation
Each model runs in its own isolated Python environment. Do not attempt to mix dependencies across environments, as this can cause version conflicts.
:::

### 5.2 Model Weight Downloads

First-time executions download model weights:

| Model | Weight Size | Download Time | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Atlas CRPS | ~30 GB | ~31 min | Largest model |
| Aurora 1.5 | ~7 GB | ~7 min | Multi-variable |
| AIFS v2 ENS | ~5 GB | ~5 min | Ensemble model |
| FGN Mini | 1.1 GB | ~2 min | Includes sample file |
| GraphCast | ~15 GB | ~10 min | Google DeepMind |
| NeuralGCM | ~12 GB | ~8 min | Hybrid model |
| AIFS v2 single | ~5 GB | ~5 min | Deterministic |

## 6. FGN (WeatherNext 2) Configuration

FGN requires special configuration due to its unique data requirements.

### 6.1 Starting Conditions

Google publishes FGN-ready inputs for only one date (2024-10-07 00Z). For other dates, Demo 3 uses a converter:

```bash
# Converter runs in e2s018 environment
python runners/fgn_convert.py --date 2024-10-08
```

**Converter workflow:**
1. Downloads ECMWF IFS analyses at 13 pressure levels
2. Regrids to FGN's 1° resolution
3. Constructs Google's expected file layout

:::{warning}
#### Sea Surface Temperature Approximation
The converter uses IFS skin temperature over oceans, floored at 271.46 K under sea ice. This introduces a small bias (correlation 0.997, mean error -0.08 K) compared to true SST.
:::

### 6.2 FGN-Specific Configuration

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DEMO3_FGN_DIR` | `~/.cache/fgn` | FGN weights and sample file location |
| Sample file date | 2024-10-07 | Google's published input (up to 7.5 days) |
| Converted input cache | `outputs/_fgn_inputs/` | 53 MB per start date, reused for subsequent runs |

### 6.3 FGN Performance

- **10-day, 3-member forecast**: ~2 minutes, 1.8 GB peak memory
- **Model variant**: `WeatherNextCyclones_Mini` (1° resolution, only Mini weights published)
- **Full 0.25° model**: Does not fit in Spark memory

## 7. ROMP/MOMP Benchmarking Configuration

The ROMP (Rainy season Onset Metrics Package) pipeline has its own configuration system.

### 7.1 Configuration File Structure

ROMP uses configuration files (e.g., `notebooks/config_et.in`) to define:

| Parameter | Example Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wet_init` | 20 mm | Minimum initial rainfall for onset candidate |
| `wet_spell` | 3 days | Consecutive wet days required |
| `wet_threshold` | 1 mm/day | Daily rainfall threshold for "wet" |
| `dry_spell` | 7 days | Dry spell length that vetoes onset |
| `dry_threshold` | 1 mm/day | Daily rainfall threshold for "dry" |
| `dry_extent` | 20 days | Window after candidate for veto |
| `start_date` | June 1 | Season search window start |
| `end_date` | September 30 | Season search window end |
| `verification_window` | Days 1-15, Days 16-30 | Lead time windows to evaluate |
| `matching_tolerance` | 3 days (1-15), 5 days (16-30) | How close forecast must match observation |
| `run_mode` | DET or PROB | Deterministic or probabilistic track |

### 7.2 Running ROMP

```bash
# Deterministic evaluation
momp-run -p notebooks/config_et.in --mode det

# Probabilistic evaluation
momp-run -p notebooks/config_et.in --mode prob
```

:::{warning}
#### Track Separation
Deterministic and probabilistic tracks use non-comparable metric families and must never be mixed within a single evaluation run.
:::

### 7.3 Model Registration

Models are registered centrally in `BENCHMARK_MODEL_CATALOG` within `config.py`:

| Model | Type | Resolution | Track |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AIFS | Deterministic | 0.25° | DET |
| FuXi | Deterministic | 0.25° | DET |
| GraphCast | Deterministic | 0.25° | DET |
| AIFS-ENS | Probabilistic (50 members) | 0.25° | PROB |
| GenCast | Probabilistic (52 members) | 0.25° | PROB |

### 7.4 Data Sources

| Data Type | Sources | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Observations | CHIRPS, ENACTS | 0.05°, 0.1° |
| Forecasts | Model reforecasts | 0.25° (common grid) |
| Seasonal mask | `jjas_seasonal_mask_0p25.nc` | 0.25° |

## 8. Essential Libraries

### 8.1 Core Dependencies

AI weather models require specialized libraries for:

| Library | Purpose | Models Using It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **earth2grid** | Grid interpolation and coordinate transformations | All models |
| **NATTEN** | Neighborhood attention for efficient transformers | GraphCast, NeuralGCM |
| **xarray** | Multi-dimensional array handling | All models |
| **PyTorch** | Deep learning framework | Aurora, AIFS, FuXi |
| **JAX** | High-performance numerical computing | GraphCast, NeuralGCM, FGN |
| **NetCDF4** | Weather data I/O | All models |
| **Streamlit** | Web interface framework | Demo 3 UI |

### 8.2 Library Versions

Pinned in `docker/locks/` for reproducibility. Key versions:
- PyTorch: 2.1+ (CUDA 12.x)
- JAX: 0.4+ (with CUDA support)
- xarray: 2023.x+
- earth2grid: Custom build
- NATTEN: Custom build

## 9. Troubleshooting

### 9.1 Common Issues

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker run` fails: `unresolvable CDI devices` | Docker started before GPU registry populated | `systemctl --user restart docker`, then `docker start demo3` |
| `docker: Conflict ... name "/demo3" is already in use` | Stale container exists | `docker start demo3` or `docker rm -f demo3 && bash docker/run.sh` |
| Browser can't reach `localhost:8501` | SSH tunnel not open or port conflict | Use `-L 8502:localhost:8501` and navigate to `:8502` |
| Run fails during starting condition download | ECMWF/Google mirrors throttled | Retry or use `DEMO3_IFS_SOURCE=azure` |
| First model run is exceptionally slow | Downloading model weights (~30 min for Atlas CRPS) | Expected behavior; subsequent runs are fast |
| ROMP run stops after switching tracks | DET and PROB mixed in one run | Set mode in config or with `--mode`, run separately |
| Model missing from ROMP output | Not registered for that track | Check `BENCHMARK_MODEL_CATALOG` in `config.py` |
| Many blank grid cells in ROMP maps | No onset detected or no matched events | Check onset thresholds, search window, mask, data coverage |
| Grid or shape errors when loading data | Forecast and observation grids differ | Ensure common grid, mask file, and resolution |

### 9.2 Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps -a | grep demo3

# View container logs
docker logs -f demo3

# Check GPU allocation
nvidia-smi

# Verify Docker service
systemctl --user status docker

# Check disk space
df -h ~/.cache/demo3/
```

:::{tip}
#### Proactive Monitoring
Run `docker logs -f demo3` in a separate terminal while testing to catch errors in real-time. This is especially useful during first-time model runs when weights are being downloaded.
:::

## 10. Everyday Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Monitor real-time application logs
docker logs -f demo3

# Gracefully restart the application container
docker restart demo3

# Fetch latest code (takes effect immediately if DEV=1; otherwise requires rebuild)
git pull

# Full rebuild and restart cycle
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile . && docker rm -f demo3 && bash docker/run.sh

# Clean up old containers
docker system prune -f

# Check container resource usage
docker stats demo3
```

## 11. Best Practices

### 11.1 Environment Setup Checklist

Before running AI weather models, verify:

- [ ] GPU is visible to Docker (`nvidia-smi -L` works in container)
- [ ] Docker service is running (`systemctl --user status docker`)
- [ ] Container image is built or loaded (`docker images | grep demo3`)
- [ ] Sufficient disk space for model weights (~75 GB)
- [ ] SSH tunnel is active (if accessing remotely)
- [ ] Network connectivity to ECMWF/Google data sources
- [ ] ROMP config file is properly configured (if running benchmarks)

### 11.2 Performance Optimization

- **Use pre-built images**: Transfer images between Sparks instead of rebuilding
- **Cache model weights**: Use `DEMO3_CACHE` to point to shared storage
- **Pre-run heavy models**: Aurora 1.5 (~26 min) and Atlas CRPS (~19 min) should be pre-run for classroom demonstrations
- **Monitor GPU utilization**: Use `nvidia-smi` to ensure models are using GPU acceleration
- **Separate DET and PROB tracks**: Never mix deterministic and probabilistic evaluations

### 11.3 Reporting Checklist

Every benchmark result should document:
- [ ] Onset definition parameters (for ROMP)
- [ ] Verification dataset and resolution
- [ ] Model, reforecast period, initialization dates, number of members
- [ ] Lead-time windows and matching tolerance
- [ ] Reference used for skill scores
- [ ] Track (DET or PROB), and whether forecasts were calibrated
- [ ] Package version and config file used

## Summary

- GPU visibility must be verified before running AI weather models in containers
- Docker rootless mode with NVIDIA CDI provides secure GPU passthrough
- Runtime configuration flags control development mode, caching, and data sources
- Model weights are downloaded once and cached locally
- Model-specific environments ensure dependency isolation
- FGN requires special configuration for starting conditions
- ROMP/MOMP has its own configuration system for benchmarking
- Essential libraries include earth2grid, NATTEN, and model-specific frameworks
- Troubleshooting common issues requires understanding Docker, GPU, and network interactions
- Always document configuration choices with benchmark results

## Exercises

:::{exercise}
#### Exercise 2: Diagnose GPU Access (10 min)
You SSH into a DGX Spark after a reboot and try to run a container, but get the error:
```
docker: Error response from daemon: unresolvable CDI devices nvidia.com/gpu=all
```

1. What caused this error?
2. What command do you run to fix it immediately?
3. What configuration change prevents this from happening after future reboots?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

1. **Cause**: Docker started before the NVIDIA CDI registry was populated after the reboot.
2. **Immediate fix**: `systemctl --user restart docker`
3. **Prevention**: Create `~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/wait-for-gpu.conf` with the ExecStartPre hook that waits for `/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml`.

</details>
:::

:::{exercise}
#### Exercise 3: Container Management (5 min)
You need to update the code in your running container without rebuilding the entire image. What environment variable do you set, and what command do you run?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

Set `DEV=1` to mount the local directory into the container:

```bash
DEV=1 bash docker/run.sh
```

This allows you to edit code locally and see changes immediately without rebuilding.

</details>
:::

:::{exercise}
#### Exercise 4: Configure ROMP Benchmark (15 min)
You want to run a deterministic benchmark for Ethiopia's Kiremt season with the following requirements:
- Wet spell: 3 consecutive days ≥ 2 mm/day
- Dry spell veto: 7 consecutive days < 1 mm within 20 days
- Verification windows: Days 1-15 and Days 16-30
- Models: AIFS, GraphCast

Write the configuration parameters you would set in `config_et.in`.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```
wet_init = 20
wet_spell = 3
wet_threshold = 2
dry_spell = 7
dry_threshold = 1
dry_extent = 20
start_date = 2015-06-01
end_date = 2022-09-30
verification_windows = [1-15, 16-30]
matching_tolerance = {1-15: 3, 16-30: 5}
run_mode = DET
models = [AIFS, GraphCast]
```
