# Running  AI Weather Forecast Model on a DGX Spark


## 1. Environment and Workflow Setup


Step-by-step setup for the Demo 3 Streamlit platform (AI forecast lab). Everything runs in
one Docker container on the Spark; you open the page in your laptop's browser through an
SSH tunnel.

There are two ways in:

- **A. Use a Spark where Demo 3 already runs** (e.g. `hcwfpgx`): only step 5 below.
  You need Tailscale access to the Spark and an account on it.
- **B. Set up your own Spark:** steps 1–5. Budget about an hour for the first build,
  plus model downloads on first use (or copy them from a Spark that has them; step 4).

---

### 1. Check Docker can see the GPU

The Sparks run Docker rootless with NVIDIA's CDI device list. This should print the GPU:

~~~{bash}
docker run --rm --device nvidia.com/gpu=all ubuntu nvidia-smi -L
~~~

If it fails with `unresolvable CDI devices nvidia.com/gpu=all`, Docker started before the
GPU list existed (common right after a reboot). Restart Docker and try again:

```bash
systemctl --user restart docker
```

To stop this happening after every reboot, make Docker wait for the GPU list:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d
cat > ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/wait-for-gpu.conf <<'EOF'
[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c "for i in $(seq 120); do [ -s /var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml ] && exit 0; sleep 1; done; exit 0"
EOF
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### 2. Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mesfind/ai_weather.git
cd ai_weather/demo3
```

### 3. Build the image (once, ~1 hour)

```bash
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Most of the hour is compiling two libraries (earth2grid, NATTEN). Later rebuilds reuse
Docker's cache and take seconds unless `docker/locks/` changes. The image holds the page
and every model's Python environment; model weights are not inside it.

**Faster alternative:** copy the image from a Spark that already built it.

```bash
# on the Spark that has it
docker save demo3 | gzip > demo3-image.tar.gz
# copy the file over (scp/rsync over Tailscale), then on the new Spark
docker load < demo3-image.tar.gz
```

### 4. Start it

```bash
bash docker/run.sh
```

This starts a container named `demo3` that restarts by itself after reboots, and keeps:

| What | Where on the Spark | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Saved forecasts, event movies, job logs | `ai_weather/demo3/outputs/` | grows with use |
| Model weights (downloaded on each model's first run) | `~/.cache/demo3/` | up to ~75 GB |

Options (put them before `bash docker/run.sh`):

- `DEV=1`: use the code in this folder instead of the copy inside the image, so
  `git pull` (or editing a file) changes the page without a rebuild. Use this while developing.
- `DEMO3_CACHE=/path`: keep model weights somewhere else (e.g. an existing cache).
- `DEMO3_IFS_SOURCE=azure`: download ECMWF data from the Azure mirror if AWS is slow.

**Skip the first-run downloads and get the saved runs** by copying them from a Spark that
has them (replace `<user>@<spark>` and the source paths with the right ones):

```bash
rsync -a --info=progress2 <user>@<spark>:<its weights cache>/ ~/.cache/demo3/
rsync -a --info=progress2 <user>@<spark>:ai_weather/demo3/outputs/ ai_weather/demo3/outputs/
```

On `hcwfpgx` the weights cache is `~/e2s-spark/root_cache`.

### 5. Open the page

From your laptop (on Tailscale):

```bash
ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 <user>@<spark>
```

Leave that terminal open and browse to **http://localhost:8501**.

### Trying it

1. Pick **Deterministic** or **Probabilistic**, then a model. The card shows its run time
   on the Spark and what it can't do (e.g. NeuralGCM has no 2 m temperature).
2. Pick a start date (the caption under it gives the model's allowed range and why),
   lead time, members, country and use case.
3. **Load saved run** appears when a matching forecast is already saved (instant);
   otherwise **Run forecast** runs the model on the Spark with a progress bar.
4. Explore the result tabs, and the **Event movie** tab for forecast vs observations.

Slow models (Aurora 1.5 ~26 min, Atlas CRPS ~19 min for 10 days) are best pre-run and
loaded in class.

### Everyday commands

```bash
docker logs -f demo3                 # page log
docker restart demo3                 # restart the page
git pull                             # update the code (live with DEV=1; otherwise rebuild)
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile . && docker rm -f demo3 && bash docker/run.sh
                                     # rebuild and restart with the new image
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `docker run` fails: `unresolvable CDI devices` | `systemctl --user restart docker`, then `docker start demo3` (see step 1 to prevent it) |
| `docker: Conflict ... name "/demo3" is already in use` | a container exists already: `docker start demo3`, or `docker rm -f demo3` and run again |
| Browser can't reach localhost:8501 | the SSH tunnel isn't open, or port 8501 is busy on your laptop: use `-L 8502:localhost:8501` and open :8502 |
| A run fails while downloading starting conditions | ECMWF/Google mirror busy: try again, or start with `DEMO3_IFS_SOURCE=azure` |
| First run of a model is slow | it is downloading the weights once (Atlas CRPS ~30 min); later runs start in seconds |

### 2. Use-Case Group Execution
- Split participants into their designated use-case groups. 
- Ensure each group uses the specific flag in the code that distinguishes their use case:
  - **Temperature Exceedance:** Led by Docko, supported by Narayana.
  - **Precipitation Exceedance (Short-run rainfall):** Led by Koomi, supported by Shruti.
  - **Onset/Cessation:** Led Aryan, supported by Panchali.

## 3. Timings on the Spark for a 10-day forecast

| Model | Members | Time | Peak GPU memory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AIFS v2 single | 1 | ~2 min | 14 GB |
| FGN Mini (1°) | 3 | ~2 min* | 1.8 GB |
| NeuralGCM (2.8°) | 3 | ~2.5 min | 18 GB |
| GraphCast | 1 | ~3.5 min | 16 GB |
| AIFS v2 ENS | 3 | ~5.5 min | 25 GB |
| Atlas CRPS | 3 | ~19 min | 33 GB |
| Aurora 1.5 | 1 | ~26 min | 27 GB |

* **FGN:** measured 106 s for Google’s 7.5-day sample case; the 10-day time is scaled up from that

Times include downloading the starting conditions (from Google’s ERA5 copy or ECMWF), except FGN, which starts from Google’s sample file. Model weights were already downloaded

The first run of each model is slower because the weights download once: about 31 min extra for Atlas CRPS, 7 min for Aurora 1.5 and 5 min for AIFS v2 ENS
