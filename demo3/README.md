# Demo 3 — Running Your First AI Weather Forecast

A Streamlit app, running on the DGX Spark, for running AI weather models. Participants choose a model, start date, lead time, region and use case (heat or precipitation), run the forecast (or load a saved run), and compare it with observations.

**Status:**
- All 7 models run live on the Spark from one Docker image (`docker/`), and saved runs load instantly.
- The event movie tab (forecast vs observations) is Panchali's `demo3/event_movie/forecast_event_movie.py`.
- Results are Panchali's event movie (forecast next to ERA5 observations, day by day) and event-track map, for heat or precipitation.

## Run it

**Full step-by-step setup (new Spark, GPU check, copying weights, troubleshooting): [SETUP.md](SETUP.md).**

**On the Spark** (aarch64; build once, about an hour, mostly compiling two libraries):

```bash
cd ~/ai_weather/demo3
docker build -t demo3 -f docker/Dockerfile .
bash docker/run.sh            # or DEV=1 bash docker/run.sh to use this folder's code live
```

`run.sh` keeps saved runs in `outputs/` and model weights (~90 GB, downloaded on each model's
first run) in `~/.cache/demo3`; set `DEMO3_CACHE` to reuse an existing cache.

**From your laptop:** open a tunnel, then browse to http://localhost:8501.

```bash
ssh -L 8501:localhost:8501 <you>@hcwfpgx
```

**After a reboot**, if the container won't start with "unresolvable CDI devices", Docker started
before the GPU list existed: `systemctl --user restart docker && docker start demo3`.

**Environments in the image** (`/opt/envs/<env>`, pinned in `docker/locks/`):
`e2s018` Atlas CRPS, Aurora 1.5, AIFS v2 single · `e2s018ens` AIFS v2 ENS ·
`graphcast` GraphCast and NeuralGCM · `fgn` FGN · `ui` the page.

## Layout

```
app.py                 Streamlit page: steps 2–3 and results
demo3/catalog.py       the 7 models (type, environment, lead-time limit, members)
demo3/regions.py       program countries → padded plotting boxes
demo3/contract.py      the output-file format every runner writes
demo3/store.py         where outputs live; reusing saved runs
demo3/jobs.py          launches runs in the background and tracks progress
demo3/movie.py         runs the event movie in the background for the loaded run
demo3/event_movie/     Panchali's forecast_event_movie.py (unchanged) + the Spark adapter
demo3/theme.py         styling, matching the Demo 5 platform
runners/run_model.py   runner entry point (+ synthetic output generator)
runners/fgn_convert.py FGN starting conditions from ECMWF open data (see the FGN section)
timings.json           measured Spark runtimes shown in brackets in the app
docker/                the image: Dockerfile, run.sh, per-environment package locks
outputs/               saved runs: outputs/{model}/{YYYYMMDDTHH}_{lead}h_m{members}.nc
```

## Output format (what the plots receive)

Each run is one NetCDF file covering the whole globe:

| | |
|---|---|
| dims | `ensemble, lead_time, lat, lon` (`ensemble` has size 1 for deterministic models) |
| `lead_time` | integer hours after the start time: 0, 6, 12, … |
| `lat` / `lon` | ascending; lon runs −180 to 180 |
| `tp` | precipitation accumulated over the previous 6 h, in **mm** (NaN at lead 0) |
| `t2m` | 2 m temperature, in **K** |
| `z500` | 500 hPa geopotential, in **m² s⁻²** (divide by 9.80665 to get height in m) |
| coords | `valid_time` (along lead_time), `init_time` |
| attrs | `model`, `model_name`, `init_source`, `members`, `synthetic` |

## Results: the event movie

The results are Panchali's `demo3/event_movie/forecast_event_movie.py`, kept unchanged
(drop in new versions as they come). `run_event_movie.py` adapts it to the Spark: it reads
Demo 3's output files, and fetches ERA5 observations from Google's ARCO copy (cached in
`outputs/_obs_cache/`) when the cluster's ERA5 folder isn't there. The use case picks the
movie: **Heat** = daily max 2 m temperature, **Precipitation** = daily rainfall. Each movie is
rendered once per request and saved under `outputs/_movies/`.

To get test data without a GPU, turn on **Use synthetic output** in the sidebar and press Run. This writes a fake file in exactly this format.

## FGN (WeatherNext 2): starting conditions from ECMWF open data

FGN is not in Earth2Studio, and Google publishes FGN-ready inputs for one date only
(2024-10-07 00Z). The full 0.25° model does not fit in a Spark's memory, so Demo 3 runs
Google's 1° Mini model (`WeatherNextCyclones_Mini`, the only Mini weights published).

**Converter** (`runners/fgn_convert.py`, runs in the `e2s018` environment)
- Downloads ECMWF's IFS analyses (step 0) for the start time and 6 hours earlier, at FGN's
  13 pressure levels, puts them on FGN's 1° grid (taking the 1° points) and writes Google's
  file layout. Works for any date ECMWF open data covers (from 2024-03-01).
- What open data lacks, and what stands in for it:
  - sea-surface temperature: IFS skin temperature over the ocean, floored at seawater
    freezing (271.46 K) under sea ice;
  - surface geopotential and land–sea mask: fixed fields, copied from Google's sample file.
- Checked against Google's own 2024-10-07 file, rebuilt from ECMWF data: every field matches
  to within rounding (correlation 1.000), so Google built theirs the same way. The one
  approximation is sea-surface temperature (correlation 0.997, 0.08 K too cold on average).
- From the same 2026-05-15 start, FGN and AIFS v2 agree closely at 24–48 h (z500 and 2 m
  temperature correlation ≥ 0.999).

**Runner** (`runners/runner_fgn.py`)
- Starting conditions: Google's sample file on 2024-10-07 (up to 7.5 days); the converter for
  every other date.
- First run: downloads the weights and the sample file (1.1 GB) from Google into
  `DEMO3_FGN_DIR` (default `~/.cache/fgn`), so each Spark sets itself up.
- Caches converted inputs (53 MB per start date) in `outputs/_fgn_inputs/`, so a rerun of the
  same date skips the conversion (~95 s).
- 10 days, 3 members: ~2 min on the GPU, 1.8 GB peak memory.

## Adding a model

1. Create `runners/runner_<model_key>.py` with `run(init, lead_hours, members, report) -> xr.Dataset`, returning `tp`, `t2m` and `z500` in the units above.
2. Make sure the model's environment exists at `/opt/envs/<env>/bin/python` inside the container.
3. Set `status="ready"` for that model in `demo3/catalog.py`.
4. Add its measured runtime to `timings.json`.
